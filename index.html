    <title>Hellizen — Just a man looking for lots of patience, and a quite & lonely life.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Hellizen is a full-stack web developer born in a small city of Pakistan. He loves NodeJS, and can't understand how the various front-end JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS, VueJS, and AngularJS etc. work. Raised in a toxic environment, he's proud of the fact that he's blessed with patience and the ability to stay calm even in the worst of times; but, don't take his quietness for weakness, for he is not one to be trifled with when he loses patience. His only wish in life is to have a small home in the cold mountainous regions of Pakistan, where he will spend his days worshipping his lord, and one day, breath his last and gain eternal peace.">
